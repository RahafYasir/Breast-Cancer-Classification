# Breast-Cancer-Detection
This project is a demonstration of how to create a breast cancer detection using machine learning. In the notebook uploaded the data is read, analysed and visualized. Data engineering step is included to improve performance. Multiple classification models used for comparison. Finally, each model is evaluated using different evaluation metrics.

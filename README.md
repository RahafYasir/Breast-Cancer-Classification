# Breast-Cancer-Detection
This project is a demonstration of how to create a breast cancer classification model using Machine Learning. In the notebook uploaded the data is read, analysed and visualized. Data engineering step is included to improve performance. Multiple classification models are used for comparison including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier. Finally, each model is evaluated using different evaluation metrics.
